Future & Callable
=================

Callable<V>:
------------
- Like Runnable but returns a result
- Can throw checked exceptions
- Single method: V call() throws Exception

Future<V>:
----------
- Represents the result of an asynchronous computation
- Returned when submitting Callable to ExecutorService

Key Methods:
------------
get()                    - Blocks until result is available
get(timeout, unit)       - Blocks with timeout, throws TimeoutException
isDone()                 - Returns true if task completed
isCancelled()            - Returns true if task was cancelled
cancel(mayInterrupt)     - Attempts to cancel the task

CompletableFuture (Java 8+):
----------------------------
- Enhanced Future with completion callbacks
- Supports chaining: thenApply(), thenAccept(), thenCompose()
- Can be completed manually: complete(), completeExceptionally()
- Supports combining multiple futures: allOf(), anyOf()

Chaining Thread Behavior:
-------------------------
- The thread that completes the first stage executes the next chain (by default)
- Use *Async() variants to run on a different thread

Method                          Thread Behavior
------                          ---------------
thenApply()                     Runs on thread that completed previous stage
thenApplyAsync()                Runs on a different thread (ForkJoinPool)
thenApplyAsync(fn, executor)    Runs on specified executor's thread

Example:
// Thread-1 executes stage 1
// Thread-1 ALSO executes stage 2 (same thread continues)
CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> "A")
    .thenApply(s -> s + "B");

// Thread-1 executes stage 1
// Thread-2 executes stage 2 (different thread)
CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> "A")
    .thenApplyAsync(s -> s + "B");
