Compare-And-Swap (CAS)
======================

What is CAS?
------------
- Low-level atomic operation supported by hardware
- Compares current value with expected value
- If equal, updates to new value atomically
- Returns boolean indicating success/failure

How it works:
-------------
compareAndSet(expectedValue, newValue)
1. Read current value
2. Compare with expectedValue
3. If equal, set to newValue and return true
4. If not equal, return false (another thread modified it)

Spin-Lock Pattern:
------------------
while (!lock.compareAndSet(false, true)) {
    // Keep trying until lock is acquired (busy-waiting)
}

Advantages:
-----------
- No thread blocking (lock-free)
- No context switching overhead
- Efficient for low-contention scenarios

Disadvantages:
--------------
- Busy-waiting consumes CPU cycles
- Not suitable for high-contention scenarios
- Can cause starvation if one thread keeps failing
