Thread Creation in Java
=======================

1. Extending Thread class
   - Create a class that extends Thread
   - Override the run() method
   - Create instance and call start()
   - Limitation: Cannot extend another class (Java single inheritance)

2. Implementing Runnable interface
   - Create a class that implements Runnable
   - Implement the run() method
   - Pass instance to Thread constructor and call start()
   - Advantage: Can extend another class

3. Anonymous inner class
   - Create Runnable as anonymous class inline
   - Useful for one-time use threads

4. Lambda expression (Java 8+)
   - Runnable is a functional interface (single abstract method)
   - Can use lambda: new Thread(() -> { ... }).start()
   - Most concise approach
