Thread Signaling (wait/notify)
==============================

Methods: wait(), notify(), notifyAll()

Key Points:
-----------
- Must be called from within a synchronized block or method
- Must hold the synchronization lock on the object being called
- If called without holding the lock: IllegalMonitorStateException

wait()
------
- Causes current thread to release the lock
- Thread enters waiting state
- Waits until another thread calls notify() or notifyAll() on same object

notify()
--------
- Wakes up a single thread waiting on the object's monitor
- Which thread is awakened is not guaranteed (JVM decides)

notifyAll()
-----------
- Wakes up ALL threads waiting on the object's monitor
- Lock will be acquired by one of the awakened threads
- Which specific thread acquires lock is determined by thread scheduler
- Awakened threads must re-acquire lock before resuming execution
