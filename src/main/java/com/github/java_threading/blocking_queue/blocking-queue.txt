BlockingQueue
=============

- Thread-safe interface extending Queue
- Designed for producer-consumer scenarios
- Provides blocking operations (wait when full/empty)
- Does NOT permit null elements (throws NullPointerException)

Implementations:
----------------
LinkedBlockingQueue
- Does not preallocate size (optionally bounded)
- Uses separate locks: putLock and takeLock
- Better throughput for high concurrency

ArrayBlockingQueue
- Pre-allocates fixed size array
- Uses single ReentrantLock for both put and take
- More predictable memory usage

Write Operations:
-----------------
add(e)    - Throws IllegalStateException if queue is full
put(e)    - Blocks until space is available (waits indefinitely)
offer(e)  - Returns false immediately if queue is full (non-blocking)

Read Operations:
----------------
take()    - Blocks until element is available
poll()    - Returns null immediately if queue is empty (non-blocking)
peek()    - Returns head without removing, null if empty

Use Cases:
----------
- Producer-consumer pattern
- Thread pool task queues
- Rate limiting
- Buffering between fast producer and slow consumer
