Fork/Join Framework
===================

Purpose:
--------
- Designed for divide-and-conquer algorithms
- Efficiently uses multiple processors
- Work-stealing algorithm for load balancing

ForkJoinPool:
-------------
- Specialized ExecutorService for fork/join tasks
- ForkJoinPool.commonPool() - shared pool (default) will have the parallelism count as Number of CPU present.
- new ForkJoinPool(parallelism) - custom pool with thread count

RecursiveTask<V> (returns result):
----------------------------------
- Extends ForkJoinTask<V>
- Override compute() method
- Returns a value of type V
- Use when you need to aggregate results from subtasks

RecursiveAction (no return value):
----------------------------------
- Extends ForkJoinTask<Void>
- Override compute() method
- Returns void
- Use for side-effect operations (logging, updating shared state)

Key Methods:
------------
fork()  - Asynchronously execute task in pool
join()  - Wait for task completion and get result
invoke() - Execute and wait (fork + join combined)

Work-Stealing:
--------------
- Idle threads steal tasks from busy threads' queues
- Improves CPU utilization
- Tasks are taken from the tail of other threads' deques
