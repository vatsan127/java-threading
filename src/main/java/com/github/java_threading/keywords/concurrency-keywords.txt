Core Concurrency Keywords
=========================

1. volatile
-----------
- Applies only to variables
- Ensures visibility of changes across threads
- Does NOT provide atomicity or mutual exclusion
- Variable is stored directly in RAM rather than being cached
- All threads see the most recent value
- Use case: Flags for signaling between threads

2. synchronized
---------------
- Can be applied to methods or blocks
- Provides both visibility AND atomicity
- Only one thread can execute synchronized code on same lock at a time
- Static synchronized methods lock on the Class object
- Instance synchronized methods lock on the instance (this)
- Synchronized blocks can lock on any object

3. Atomic (java.util.concurrent.atomic)
---------------------------------------
- Atomic classes provide lock-free, thread-safe operations
- Uses compare-and-swap (CAS) hardware instructions
- Examples: AtomicInteger, AtomicLong, AtomicBoolean, AtomicReference
- Common methods: get(), set(), incrementAndGet(), compareAndSet()
- More efficient than synchronized for single variable operations
