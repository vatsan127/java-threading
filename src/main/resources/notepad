wait or notify / notifyAll cannot be called for that object unless that object is synchronized (synchronized block / method).


when wait() is called it releases the synchronization on that object.

calling notify() will wake up one thread that has called wait().

Deadlock is a situation where 2 threads need t2o or more locks. They succeed in making one lock but for the lock they wait indefinitely to compless the task.

Synchronized methods lock the entire method using the object's intrinsic lock (this for instance methods, or the class object for static methods

so for static and instance methods the locks will be different?
